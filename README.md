# EWB-Website-Design
Prototype redesign of the EWB Website

Redesign of the EWB Website (original website can be seen here: http://www.nyuewb.org/) using the bootstrap framework. Team members include An Vu and Meghan Clark. We are predominantely tasked with changing the front end look of the site, making it look more professional, sleeker and overall a better website to attract not only new members to join the club but for outside sponsors who would like to be apart of the ewb team NYU chapter.
